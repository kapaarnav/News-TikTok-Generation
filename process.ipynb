For too long, we've allowed our progress to stagnate, our innovation to wane. But I stand before you today to announce a bold initiative, a decisive action to reignite the American spirit of discovery and propel us into a future defined by technological dominance.\n",

We’ve witnessed a decline in our global competitiveness, a lagging investment in crucial research and development, and a brain drain that sees our brightest minds seeking opportunities elsewhere. We've fallen behind in critical technological fields, jeopardizing our national security and economic prosperity.\n",

This isn't a rehash of past efforts; this is a revitalized, reinvigorated body, assembled with the singular purpose of restoring American leadership in science and technology.\n",

It will be a dynamic force, actively shaping policy, driving innovation, and ensuring that our investments in research and development are strategically targeted and yield tangible results.  We're talking about focusing on breakthroughs in:\n",

      "* **Semiconductors:**  Strengthening our domestic production capabilities, ensuring our technological independence and economic security in this vital sector.  We cannot allow our reliance on foreign sources to compromise our national interests.\n",
      "* **Biotechnology and Biomedical Advances:**  Investing in the cutting-edge research that will lead to breakthroughs in healthcare, improving lives and strengthening our global leadership in this vital area.\n",
